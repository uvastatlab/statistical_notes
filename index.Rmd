Demonstration of using term plots to detect departures from linearity for coefficients. Shows the base R `termplot()` and `car::crPlots()` functions.

- [Compact Letter Displays](cld.html) (Clay Ford, 2024-03-24)    
How to create and interpret Compact Letter Displays, though [some people don't like them](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/275832/interpreting-compact-letter-displays-and-tukey-multiple-comparisons-from-glmm#comment829280_275832).

Recoding example using a lookup table.

- [Multi-level model example using simulated data](example_analysis.html) (Clay Ford, 2023-10-03)    
Example of multi-level model written for someone who was brand new to R. Includes demo of {emmeans} and {ggeffects}.

- [Data wrangling consultation](consultation_summary_2023-08-28.html) (Clay Ford, 2023-08-28)
