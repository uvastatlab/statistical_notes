How to extract specific interactions from a data frame identified in an UpSet plot.

- [Investigating Multicolinearity](investigating_multicollinearity.html) (Clay Ford, 2025-03-19)   
Investigating multicolinearity and challenging idea of inspecting pairwise correlations before fitting a model and dropping highly correlated predictors.

Elaborating on the {ggeffects} vignette, [Difference Between Marginalization Methods: The margin Argument](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/articles/technical_differencepredictemmeans.html).

An intro to polyserial and polychoric correlation using the {polycor} package. 

- [Demo of Term plots](term_plots.html) (Clay Ford, 2024-06-25)     
Demonstration of using term plots to detect departures from linearity for coefficients. Shows the base R `termplot()` and `car::crPlots()` functions.

- [Compact Letter Displays](cld.html) (Clay Ford, 2024-03-24)    
How to create and interpret Compact Letter Displays, though [some people don't like them](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/275832/interpreting-compact-letter-displays-and-tukey-multiple-comparisons-from-glmm#comment829280_275832).

- [Forced One-way ANOVA](forced_oneway_anova.html) (Clay Ford, 2023-12-01)    
Convert a two-way ANOVA into a one-way ANOVA.

- [Data wrangling consultation](consultation_summary_2023-08-28.html) (Clay Ford, 2023-08-28)     
Data wrangling tasks: (1) drop any groups with less than 10 rows, (2) drop rows with runs of zeroes greater than or equal to 5.

- [The stats::filter() function](stats_filter_function.html) (Clay Ford, 2022-10-12)      
How to use the the base R `filter()` function to calculate moving averages.

- [Three approaches to logistic regression in R](three_approaches_to_logistic_regression_in_R.html) (Clay Ford, 2022-07-18)

The normality assumption in linear modeling (multiple regression) is on the residuals, not the dependent or independent variables.

- [Stepwise Model Selection performing poorly](stepwise_simulation.html) (Clay Ford, 2020-09-01)     
Demo of stepwise model selection performing poorly in the presence of collinearity.
